Learning Golang brick by brick

Been coding for several years primarily in C, Python on systems, infrastructure and a bit of web. I have also picked up and written fun projects and production level code in C++, Java, Assembly, JS, HTML and numerous scripting languages. But I have never taken the time to learn something from the fundamentals in a detailed way since college. When I was considering interviewing, my friend and ex-colleague, mentioned that his team is developing his cloud-infra in Go, and that he found it pretty cool and refreshing especially after years of C, Py and Java. 

I have heard a lot about interviewing in something that you are most comfortable with, this time i want to step outside my comfort zone and be challenged, I think I will be fine, ok to fail initially. Ok now that is said, let me Go!

Goals 
* 1-3 months 
    * [ ] learn Go with focus on features, datastructures, algorithms, leetcode
    * [ ] document and share my programs, resources, running notes
    * [ ] interview with it
* 6-9 months
    * [ ] backend server related learning
    * [ ] build a hobby backend server I have in mind, with Go
* 12-24 months
    * [ ] connect and be a useful Gopher in the community.
    * [ ] build something production quality
