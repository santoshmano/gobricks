Learning Golang brick by brick

Been coding for several years primarily in C, Python on systems, infrastructure and a bit of web. I have also picked up several language on the go, to write fun projects and production level code, in C++, Java, Assembly, JS, HTML and numerous scripting languages. But I have never taken the time, to learn something in a detailed way from the fundamentals since college. When I was considering interviewing, my friend and ex-colleague, mentioned that his team is developing his cloud-infra in Go, and that he found it pretty cool and refreshing, after years of C, Py and Java.

I have heard a lot, from folks about interviewing in something that you are most comfortable with, this time i want to step outside my comfort zone and be challenged, I think I will be fine, I am ok with failing initially. Ok now that is said, let me Go!

Goals for this Repo 
* 1-3 months 
    * [ ] learn Go with focus on datastructures, algorithms, design & leetcode
    * [ ] document and share my programs, resources, running notes
    * [ ] interview with it
* 6-9 months
    * [ ] backend server related learning
    * [ ] build a hobby backend server I have in mind, with Go
* 12-24 months
    * [ ] connect and be a useful Gopher in the community.
    * [ ] build something production quality
